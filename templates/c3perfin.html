                <h3>Lesson 1: Introduction to Personal Finance</h3>
                <p>Basic financial concepts are essential for individuals to effectively manage their finances. Budgeting is a fundamental tool that helps individuals track income and expenses, allowing for better financial decision-making. It involves allocating funds for various needs such as housing, groceries, transportation, and entertainment while ensuring that spending does not exceed income. Additionally, budgeting enables individuals to save for emergencies, investments, and long-term goals. Financial goal setting is another crucial aspect of personal finance, as it provides direction and motivation for achieving desired outcomes. Setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals helps individuals prioritize objectives such as debt repayment, saving for retirement, purchasing a home, or funding education. By understanding these basic financial concepts, practicing effective budgeting, and setting realistic financial goals, individuals can take control of their finances and work towards a secure financial future.</p>
